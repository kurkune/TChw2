### Understanding the Four Types of Wine

1. **White Wine**
    
    White wine is made by fermenting the juice of white grapes, typically without skin contact. Known for its light and refreshing profile, white wine offers a range of flavors, from citrusy to creamy. 
    
    **Examples**:
    
    - **Sauvignon Blanc**: Known for its vibrant acidity and citrus flavors, with notes of green apple and gooseberry.
    - **Chardonnay**: Offers buttery, oaky flavors,  depending on its production.
    - **Riesling**: Ranges from dry to sweet, with floral and stone fruit notes.
    
2. **Red Wine**
    
    Red wine is produced by fermenting red or black grape varieties with their skins, which give the wine its color and tannins. Red wines are robust and full-bodied, with flavors ranging from fruity to earthy. 
    
    **Examples**:
    
    - **Cabernet Sauvignon**: Bold and full-bodied, with flavors of blackcurrant, cedar, and spice.
    - **Pinot Noir**: Light and delicate, with notes of cherry, raspberry, and earthy undertones.
    - **Malbec**: A rich, fruity wine with flavors of blackberry, plum, and cocoa.
3. **Rosé Wine**
    
    Rosé is made by allowing limited contact between red grape skins and the juice, resulting in its signature pink hue. Rosé wines offer light and fruity flavors with acidity. 
    
    **Examples**:
    
    - **Provence Rosé**: Dry, light-bodied, and elegant, with flavors of strawberry, peach, and melon.
    - **White Zinfandel**: A sweeter rosé with fruity and floral notes.
    - **Tavel**: Fuller-bodied and richer, with red berry and spice flavors.
4. **Orange Wine**
    
    Also known as skin-contact or amber wine, orange wine is made by fermenting white grape varieties with their skins for an extended period. This process gives the wine a deep orange color, bold tannins, and complex flavors, such as dried fruit, honey, and nuts. 
    
    **Examples**:
    
    - **Radikon Ribolla Gialla**: A classic orange wine with intense tannins and flavors of dried apricot and almond.
    - **Pheasant’s Tears Rkatsiteli**: Made with traditional Georgian techniques, offering bold flavors of quince, tea, and honey.
    - **Matassa Blanc**: Aromatic with notes of citrus peel and spices.

### Factors to Consider When Choosing Wine

1. **Grape Variety**
    
    Each wine type has signature grape varieties that influence its flavor:
    
    - **White Wines**: Chardonnay offers buttery, oaky notes, while Sauvignon Blanc is citrusy and herbaceous.
    - **Red Wines**: Cabernet Sauvignon delivers bold flavors of black fruit and spice, while Pinot Noir is light, with cherry and earthy notes.
    - **Rosé Wines**: Often made from Grenache, Syrah, or Sangiovese, rosé balances fruitiness and crispness.
    - **Orange Wines**: Varieties like Rkatsiteli, Sauvignon Blanc, or Pinot Grigio provide robust and earthy profiles.
2. **Region of Origin**
    
    The region greatly affects a wine’s flavor and style:
    
    - France produces iconic wines like Bordeaux (red), Chablis (white), and Provence rosé.
    - Italy offers bold reds like Chianti and vibrant whites like Pinot Grigio.
    - Georgia is renowned for traditional orange wines made in qvevri (clay vessels).
3. **Body and Tannins**
    - **White Wines**: Light-bodied options like Sauvignon Blanc contrast with fuller-bodied Chardonnay.
    - **Red Wines**: Pinot Noir is light-bodied, while Syrah and Malbec are full-bodied with bold tannins.
    - **Rosé Wines**: Typically light-bodied with minimal tannins.
    - **Orange Wines**: Medium to full-bodied with noticeable tannins.

### How to Choose the Right Wine

1. **Read the Label**
    
    Labels provide valuable information about the wine’s grape variety, region, and sweetness level. For example, look for terms like “dry,” “crisp,” or “oak-aged” for white wines, or “bold” and “full-bodied” for reds.
    
2. **Experiment with Regions and Styles**
    
    Exploring wines from different regions and styles can expand your palate. Try French Chardonnays, Italian Pinot Grigios, or Georgian orange wines to experience diverse flavors.
    
3. **Use special tools**
    
    In the “Vivino” app you can scan the wine label and read reviews of the wine, including a description of the taste and aroma.
    
4. **Taste Before Buying**
    
    Whenever possible, attend wine tastings to sample and discover what suits your palate.

### How to Serve and Enjoy Wine

1. **Storage**
    
    Store wine in a cool, dark place with consistent temperatures, ideally between 10-13°C.
    
2. **Serving Temperature**
    - **White Wines**: Serve chilled, around 7-10°C.
    - **Red Wines**: Serve slightly cooler than room temperature, around 15-18°C.
    - **Rosé Wines**: Serve chilled, similar to white wines, around 7-10°C.
    - **Orange Wines**: Serve close to red wines, around 13-15°C.
3. **Glassware**
    
    Use appropriate glassware to enhance the wine’s flavors:
    
    - White and rosé wines: A standard white wine glass works well.
    - Red and orange wines: A larger bowl-style glass enhances the wine’s aromas.
4. **Decanting**
    
    For red wines, consider decanting to allow the wine to breathe. This process softens the tannins and enhances the aroma and flavor.
    
5. **Pairing Suggestions**
    - **White Wines**: Pair with seafood, poultry, and creamy dishes.
    - **Red Wines**: Serve with red meats, roasted vegetables, and rich sauces.
    - **Rosé Wines**: Ideal with salads, soft cheeses, or grilled fish.
    - **Orange Wines**: Complements bold flavors like curry, spiced dishes, or aged cheeses.
